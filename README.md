# pigen
Generates pi you whatever place you want.

Uses the equation from the beginning of [this video](https://youtu.be/LhlqCJjbEa0), where mathematician Matt Parker calculates pi by hand for Pi Day 2018. For some reason this equation works better than others variants of the same equation that I tried (probably because the square root bit is outside the summation).

## Installation
Just download or clone this repository. You will need Python 3.

## Usage
This only applies to MacOS and probably other Unix-based systems.

There are a couple ways to run this. You can double click on it (the easiest way), which will open Terminal (or the equivalent) and prompt you for the number of digits you want. 

You can also run it in your shell by typing in the path to the pigen executable script. Running it this way gives you a couple more options than double clicking does. You can run `$ /path/to/pigen -h` to see then all, or use this table if you need help.
