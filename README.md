# pigen
Generates pi you whatever place you want.

Uses the equation from the beginning of [this video](), where mathematician Matt Parker calculates pi by hand for Pi Day 2018. For some reason this equation works better than others variants of the same equation that I tried (probably because the square root bit is outside the summation).

## Installation
Just download or clone it. You will need Python 3.

## Usage
This only applies to MacOS and probably other Unix-based systems.

There are a couple ways to run this. You can double click on it (the easiest way), or you can run it in your shell as follows:

```
$ /path/to/pigen
```
